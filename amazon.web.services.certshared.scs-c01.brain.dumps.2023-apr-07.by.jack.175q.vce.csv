A security team is creating a response plan in the event an employee executes unauthorized actions on AWS infrastructure. They want to include steps to
determine if the employee's IAM permissions changed as part of the incident.
What steps should the team document in the plan? Please select:
",A. Use AWS Config to examine the employee's IAM permissions prior to the incident and compare them to the employee's current IAM permissions.,B. Use Made to examine the employee's IAM permissions prior to the incident and compare them to the employee's A current IAM permissions.,C. Use CloudTrail to examine the employee's IAM permissions prior to the incident and compare them to the employee's current IAM permissions.,D. Use Trusted Advisor to examine the employee's IAM permissions prior to the incident and compare them to the employee's current IAM permissions.,,,,,,,,,,A,"You can use the AWSConfig history to see the history of a particular item.
The below snapshot shows an example configuration for a user in AWS Config C:\Users\wk\Desktop\mudassar\Untitled.jpg
Option B,C and D are all invalid because these services cannot be used to see the history of a particular configuration item. This can only be accomplished by
AWS Config.

During a recent security audit, it was discovered that multiple teams in a large organization have placed restricted data in multiple Amazon S3 buckets, and the
data may have been exposed. The auditor has requested that the organization identify all possible objects that contain personally identifiable information (PII) and
then determine whether this information has been accessed.
What solution will allow the Security team to complete this request?
","A. Using Amazon Athena, query the impacted S3 buckets by using the PII query identifier functio","B. Then, create a new Amazon CloudWatch metric for Amazon S3 object access to alert when the objects are accessed.","C. Enable Amazon Macie on the S3 buckets that were impacted, then perform data classificatio","D. For identified objects that contain PII, use the research function for auditing AWS CloudTrail logs and S3 bucket logs for GET operations.","E.

Using the PII findings report from GuardDuty, query the S3 bucket logs by using Athena for GET operations.","G.

The Security Engineer has discovered that a new application that deals with highly sensitive data is storing Amazon S3 objects with the following key pattern,
which itself contains highly sensitive data.
Pattern: ""randomID_datestamp_PII.csv"" Example:
""1234567_12302017_000-00-0000 csv""
The bucket where these objects are being stored is using server-side encryption (SSE). Which solution is the most secure and cost-effective option to protect the
sensitive data?
","A. Remove the sensitive data from the object name, and store the sensitive data using S3 user-defined metadata.",B. Add an S3 bucket policy that denies the action s3:GetObject,"C.

A Developer who is following AWS best practices for secure code development requires an application to encrypt sensitive data to be stored at rest, locally in the
application, using AWS KMS. What is the simplest and MOST secure way to decrypt this data when required?
",A. Request KMS to provide the stored unencrypted data key and then use the retrieved data key to decrypt the data.,B. Keep the plaintext data key stored in Amazon DynamoDB protected with IAM policie,C. Query DynamoDB to retrieve the data key to decrypt the data,"D. Use the Encrypt API to store an encrypted version of the data key with another customer managed key.Decrypt the data key and use it to decrypt the data when
required.",E. Store the encrypted data key alongside the encrypted dat,F. Use the Decrypt API to retrieve the data key to decrypt the data when required.,,,,,,,,D,"We recommend that you use the following pattern to locally encrypt data: call the GenerateDataKey API, use the key returned in the Plaintext response field to
locally encrypt data, and then erase the plaintext data key from memory. Store the encrypted data key (contained in the CiphertextBlob field) alongside of the
locally encrypted data. The Decrypt API returns the plaintext key from the encrypted key.

In response to the past DDoS attack experiences, a Security Engineer has set up an Amazon CloudFront distribution for an Amazon S3 bucket. There is concern
that some users may bypass the CloudFront distribution and access the S3 bucket directly.
What must be done to prevent users from accessing the S3 objects directly by using URLs?
",A. Change the S3 bucket/object permission so that only the bucket owner has access.,"B. Set up a CloudFront origin access identity (OAI), and change the S3 bucket/object permission so that only the OAI has access.","C.

Which option for the use of the AWS Key Management Service (KMS) supports key management best practices that focus on minimizing the potential scope of
data exposed by a possible future key compromise?
","A. Use KMS automatic key rotation to replace the master key, and use this new master key for future encryption operations without re-encrypting previously
encrypted data.","B. Generate a new Customer Master Key (CMK), re-encrypt all existing data with the new CMK, and use it for all future encryption operations.","C. Change the CMK alias every 90 days, and update key-calling applications with the new key alias.",D. Change the CMK permissions to ensure that individuals who can provision keys are not the same individuals who can use the keys.,,,,,,,,,,B,"""automatic key rotation has no effect on the data that the CMK protects. It does not rotate the data keys that the CMK generated or re-encrypt any data protected
by the CMK, and it will not mitigate the effect of a compromised data key. You might decide to create a new CMK and use it in place of the original CMK. This has
the same effect as rotating the key material in an existing CMK, so it's often thought of as manually rotating the key.""
